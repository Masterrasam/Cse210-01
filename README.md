For Tic-Tac-Toe game files I used a version control system to develop my program. The version control system i employed was GitHub. I created a repository on Github called cse210-01 and copied the repository's url to clone it on VS code. This way, i was able to a save a copy of it in my local file. I Proceded to create a file called tic-tac-toe.py and saved it under the respository file. After writing the codes of the game, i committed it and then pushed it to my GitHub repository. This way, my work is saved on both sides. Whatever changes i made can also be staged and pushed to my GitHub repository.
